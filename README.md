# Exchange-Directory
....The Exchange is one of the best examples of a vibrant developer / user community that you'll run across. This is a model that encourages a great deal of member support. Members end up, by default, feeding into certain projects because they are rewarded for it. Forums and memberships can be sustained through this means, and our community demonstrates that choosing the appropriate drivers are key to maintaining active, healthy communities. As I interact with members here I'm both challenged to learn, and compelled to contribute this emphasis has shown through the user's experiences to foster quality interactions, and productive associations. Just to say, there's gold awaiting those that acquire that fleeting thing called vision. When you discover the why, or the mainspring, of operating in an interactive context, this raises the beauties and implies the responsibilities of fostering "the community" and that will help you to take those actions that will build, grow and sustain it. I'll just break down and tell you it's paramount that you're deriving your 'why' from an authoritative source and that you are dealing squarely.
